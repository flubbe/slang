# The Scripting Language

`slang` is a compiled and interpreted language with a garbage collector.
It is meant to not be too complicated, and many choices made in the design
reflect this. For example, the syntax is chosen so that the parser can be
made simpler, the garbage collector is using a synchronous mark-and-sweep
algorithm, and the language is single-threaded.

## A `Hello, World!` program

```
// Import the standard library.
import std;

fn main(args: [str]) -> i32
{
    std::println("Hello, World!");
    return 0;
}
```

## The syntax

Single-line comments are introduced by `//`. Multi-line comments are of the form `/* comment */`.

Ignoring comments, a program consists of:
```
<import-statements>
<constants>
<types>
<functions>
```

1. Import statements are of the form `import path::to::module`. The path
   is resolved by the file manager by going through its search paths. It picks
   the first module found in that list.

   The imports are accessible by prepending the import name, e.g. `std::print("Hello");`
   or `std::i32s{value: 12} as std::type`.
2. Constants are declared as
    ```
    const <name> : <type> = <constant>;
    ```
    They are exported by the module and can be accessed from another module.
3. Types are declared as
    ```
    struct <name> {
        <member-name1> : <member-type1>,
        <member-name2> : <member-type2>,
        ...
        <member-nameN> : <member-typeN>
    };
    ```
    They are exported by the module and can be accessed from another module.
4. Functions are exported by the module and can be accessed from another module.
    They are defined via
    ```
    fn <name>(<arg-name1> : <arg-type1>, ..., <arg-nameN> : <arg-typeN>) -> <return-type>
    {
        <statement-or-expression1>
        ...
        <statement-or-expressionM>
    }
    ```
    1. Statements:
        1. Empty statement `;`.
        2. Variable declarations: `let <name> : <type>Â [=<expression>];`. 
        
            To initialize a custom type, use
            ```
            let <name> : <type> = <type> <initializer-list>;
            ```
            where `<initializer-list>` is either listing the initial values in declaration order
            of the type,
            ```
            {<value1>, ..., <valueN>}
            ```
            or providing named initializers:
            ```
            {<member-name1> : <value1>, ..., <member-nameN> : <valueN>}
            ```
            In the latter case, <code>&lt;member-name<i>i</i>&gt; : &lt;value<i>i</i>&gt;</code> can appear in any order.
        3. `if` statements:
            ```
            if(<condition>)
            <if-block>
            [else <else-block>]
            ```
        4. `while` statement:
            ```
            while(<condition>)
            <while-block>
            ```
        5. `break` and `continue` statements:
            Break or continue a `while` loop.
        6. `return [<expression>]`: Return from a function.
    2. Expressions: TODO
    3. Type casts: 
        An expression type can be cast to another type
        when adhering to type cast rules. Type casts are indicated
        by `as` used after the to-be cast expression:
        ```
        <expression> as <type>
        ```
        Casting is allowed between `i32` and `f32`, and between any
        struct and types marked with `#[allow_cast]` (see below).

Statements and expressions can be decorated with _directives_:
```
#[directive(arg-name1=arg1,...,arg_nameN=argN)]
...
```

Currently, the following directives are used:
```
// Allow casting to and from this type. The type has to be empty.
#[allow_cast]
struct <name> {};

// Indicate that there is a struct definition in C++ code that
// is registered and checked in the interpreter.
#[native]
struct <name> {...}

// Indicate that this function has a native implementation in "<lib-name>".
#[native(lib="<lib-name>")]
fn <name>(<arg-name1> : <arg-type1>, ..., <arg-nameN> : <arg-typeN>) -> <return-type>;

fn test()
{
    // Disable compile-time constant evaluation for the next expression.
    #[disable(const_eval)]
    let t: i32 = 1*2 + 3;
    ...
}
```
Unknown directives are ignored.

## Built-in types

Built-in types are
- `void`: Indicates `<no-type>`.
- `i32`: A 32-bit integer.
- `f32`: A 32-bit floating-point number.
- `str`: A string.
- Arrays are declared as `let <name>: [<type>];`. They are of fixed length, and the length
    can be accessed with `<name>.length`. A new array can be defined as
    ```
    let <name>: [<type>] = new <type>[<size>];
    ```
    **Note:** Arrays are one-dimensional.

**Note:** The internal formats of numbers are not fixed right now. The implementation
uses whatever the underlying C++ implementation provides, but e.g. `f32` is only tested with
`IEEE754` format.

## Modules

TODO

## The standard library

After building the module, the standard library can be imported using
```
import std;
```
Currently, there are only a hand full of functions and struct's implemented.
These are:

### Types
- `#[allow_cast] struct type {}`: A generic type to cast to and from.
- `#[native] struct result`: A result type.

    _Members_:
    - `ok: i32`: Indicates whether the operation returning the type was successful.
    - `value: type`: If the operation was successful, this holds the result.

        **Note:** Needs to be cast to the expected type.
- `#[native] struct i32s`: Wrapper around an `i32`. 

    _Members_:
    - `value: i32`: An integer.
- `#[native] struct f32s`: Wrapper around an `f32`.

    _Members_:
    - `value: f32`: A 32-bit floating point value.

### Output
- `fn print(s: str) -> void`: Print a string to stdout.
- `fn println(s: str) -> void`: Print a string to stdout and append a new-line character.

### Arrays and strings
- `fn array_copy(from: type, to: type) -> void`: Copy an array. The array 
    types have to match and `from.length <= to.length`.
- `fn string_length(s: str) -> i32`: Get the length of a string.
- `fn string_concat(s1: str, s2: str) -> str`: Concatenate two strings.
- `fn string_equals(s1: str, s2: str) -> i32`: Compare two strings for equality. 
    Returns `1` if the strings compare equal, and `0` otherwise.
- `fn i32_to_string(i: i32) -> str`: Convert an `i32` value to a string.
- `fn f32_to_string(f: f32) -> str`: Convert a `f32` value to a string.
- `fn parse_i32(s: str) -> result`: Parse a string and return an `i32` integer
    wrapped in a `i32s` inside a `result`.
- `fn parse_f32(s: str) -> result`: Parse a string and return an `f32` float
    wrapped in a `f32s` inside a `result`.

### Debugging
- `fn assert(condition: i32, msg: str) -> void`: 
    Assert that `condition` does not evaluate to `0`. If `condition` evaluates
    to `0`, `msg` is emitted to stdout and the program exits with exit code `1`.

### Maths

A list of implemented constants and functions:
- `const PI: f32`
- `const SQRT2: f32`
- `fn abs(x: f32) -> f32`
- `fn sqrt(x: f32) -> f32`
- `fn ceil(x: f32) -> f32`
- `fn floor(x: f32) -> f32`
- `fn trunc(x: f32) -> f32`
- `fn round(x: f32) -> f32`
- `fn sin(x: f32) -> f32`
- `fn cos(x: f32) -> f32`
- `fn tan(x: f32) -> f32`
- `fn asin(x: f32) -> f32`
- `fn acos(x: f32) -> f32`
- `fn atan(x: f32) -> f32`
- `fn atan2(x: f32, y: f32) -> f32`

    **Note:** The behavior here for `+0` and `-0` is different from its underlying
    C++ implementation, which will be adjusted in a future iteration.
